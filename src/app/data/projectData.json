  "title": "CyberJabin: My Personal AI Memory and Growth Companion",
  "introduction": "I've always wanted an AI system that could continuously record, deeply understand, and reliably remember all my personal experiences. CyberJabin is exactly such an open-source project I'm developing, aimed at building a unique intelligent partner for myself. I can easily add my observations, experiences, and feelings, just like writing a diary. This valuable information will be transformed into deep semantic vectors and optionally stored in a vector database like Pinecone. Furthermore, the AI based on CyberJabin can retrieve and reference these 'memories' at any time, becoming my exclusive automated question-answering system.",
